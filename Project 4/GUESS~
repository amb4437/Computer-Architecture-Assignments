Question: do you think the performance of your function will depend on
    the passed limit?

Answer:

I think the higher the limit is, the more times we'll have to jump to our loop that increments the count, and in that sense it will affect our performance.  I do not think that the efficiency of the actual compare function, where we compare our current number to the limit, will change.

Question: which function will perform better? count1 or count2?

Answer:

I am already aware that using cmov is more efficient than jump statements, so I'm guessing count 2 will be more efficient.
